//stdc++.h setup on mac (without xcode)

Assuming that you've installed the homebrew and C/C++ compiler extension.
Then follow the steps. As the bits/stdc++ is a GNU GCC extension, 
where OSX uses the clang compiler.

> brew install gcc
> gcc --version
>go to the /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include directory
(go to finder, type command+shift+g, then paste the directory name)

>create a folder named bits inside this directory and then copy the stdc++.h file from this
github link (https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/precompiled/stdc%2B%2B.h).
then -
>create a file naming bits/stdc++.h inside the bits folder and paste the code copied from the github link into bits/stdc++.h file,
 then save it.

> then initially after restarting vscode, some user get a error message as 
some library is deprecated in stdc++.h.
for dismissing that error, you should add the gcc library's path to c_cpp_properties.json file's includePath.
("/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/include/c++/12",
"/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/12.2.0/include/c++/12/x86_64-apple-darwin21")
You can get this path by hovering on your #include file on code too.
add two path to your includePath section inside of C_cpp_properties.json file
I am giving the c_cpp_properties.json initial file here.
make sure your compilerPath is "/usr/bin/clang"
